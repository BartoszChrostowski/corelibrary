LeanCode Core Library
=====================

LeanCode Core Library, or CoreLib for short, is a set of helper libraries developed at [our company](https://leancode.pl) that aids our day-to-day development. It also provides a general framework on how we build apps.

Our aim is to provide an opinionated framework for .NET Core app development. As for now, we have, more-or-less, standarized:

 * App startup, config, logging & monitoring,
 * Base DDD models & it's integrations,
 * CQRS and CQRS-as-API,
 * Basic localization,
 * Some integrations with external services.

Even though we're building a framework, we try to stick to the ASP.NET Core model as close as possible and keep the "framework" part really small.

## Documentation

The CoreLib documentation is available here:

 1. [General](./general/README.me),
 2. [Basics](./basics/README.md).
