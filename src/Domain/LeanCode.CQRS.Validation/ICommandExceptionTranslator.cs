    /// extracting domain service responsible for the validation from the actual logic is not
    /// feasible because it would result in substantial code duplication or the performance penalty
    /// would be too high - that's the only reason why you should use exception translators.

    /// There are times when you need to consume some data first and there can be only one act of
    /// consumption of that data (e.g. OAuth2 code authorization or other single-usage tokens). One
    /// could be tempted to just throw when that happens and just translate the exception. This is
    /// wrong approach (@Fio≈Çek: and I'm guilty of doing just that) - you don't really have
    /// `command` there - it does not fit in the CQRS world. The solution to that is to use other
    /// mechanisms (casual API with backing app/domain services), not exception-driven development.
